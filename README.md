A simple E-commerce product page. I built this page with tailwindcss html and Javascript.
I wanted to see how the cart functionality works  in ecommerce sites, that's why i decided to build.
I plan on building an ecommerce site soon, So i figured this would be good practicce.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Live Site](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [tailwind css](https://reactjs.org/) - css framework


### What I learned

I learnt how the cart functionality works in modern ecommerce sites.
I learnt how to implement a light box using vanilla javascript

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

With what i have learnt i plan on creating an ecommerce site with next js
